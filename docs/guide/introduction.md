# Introduction

## Velius

Velius is the content creation system for the Mystery-Heini-Games. This system includes the game(s) it self, the backend of the game (where for example the Velius Script gets interpreted), the content creation tool *"MysteryMaker"* as well as it's cloud service.

## MysteryMaker

The MysteryMaker is a Windows application developed by the Velius Eninge team. It is a tool for creating dialogues and their logic.  All dialogue writing can be done using a self explaining GUI. The logic has to be written in out custom scripting language called *"Velius Script"*.

## Velius Script

All the logic of the dialogues created in MysteryMaker is written in Velius Script. It is a easy to learn imperative scripting language, developed to fit the content creator's needs. The Documentation can be found on the next Page.
