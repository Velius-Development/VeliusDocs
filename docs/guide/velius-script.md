# Velius Script <Badge text="NEW"/>

## About

Velius Script is the only language used in the whole Velius ecosystem. It had been founded by the initial development team with the goal to create a poor of syntax, easy to learn scripting language that can fit all the content creator's needs.

Velius Script is the logic's core of your MysteryMaker project. Some usecases would be:

- Switch to a different dialogue
- Set variables
- Compare variable's values
- Ask user for input

Of course, Velius Script is able to do much more than that and gets updated frequently. So to stay up to date for new Velius Script features, check out our [changelog](/custom_pages/changelog) after every update.
